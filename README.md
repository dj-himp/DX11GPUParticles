# DirectX 11 GPU Particle system

- Fully GPU particles engine I'm making for learning purpose. 
- Repo could be broken sometimes
- Constructive feedbacks/improvement/errors pointing are welcome ! (for those who want to take the time to dive into the code :) )

## Features : 
- shape emitters (point, cube, sphere) with parameters to tweak the shape
- mesh surface emitter with baked UV mapping (view independant)
- mesh surface emitter without baking (view independant) based on GDC 2018 talk "Beyong Emitters: Shader and Surface Driven GPU Particle FX Techniques" by Christina Ann Coffin
- force/velocity field from FGA file (unreal engine format)
- bitonic sort
- Curl noize

- More to come as I have ideas/time
